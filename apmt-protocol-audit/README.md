Audit of AMPT protocol contracts by Ankit Raj




-----------------------------------------------
## About

This audit report highlights the overall security of the ​ Amplify protocol and their ​ token​ . With this report, auditor has tried to ensure the reliability of the smart contract by completing the assessment of their system’s architecture and smart contract codebase. The audit has been performed according to the following procedure:

• Manual audit
1. Inspecting the code line by line and revert the initial algorithms of the protocol and then compare them with the specification
2. Manually analyzing the code for security vulnerabilities.
3. Assessing the overall project structure, complexity & quality.
4. Checking SWC Registry issues in the code.
5. Unit testing by writing custom unit testing for each function.
6. Checking whether all the libraries used in the code of the latest version.
7. Analysis of security on-chain data.
8. Analysis of the failure preparations to check how the smart contract performs in
case of bugs and vulnerability.

• Automated analysis
1. Scanning the project's code base with ​ Mythril​ , ​ Slither​ , ​ Echidna​ , ​ Manticore other’s.
2. Manually verifying (reject or confirm) all the issues found by tools.
3. Performing Unit testing.
4. Manual Security Testing (SWC-Registry, Overflow)
5. Running the tests and checking their coverage.
Report​ : All the gathered information is described in this report.
